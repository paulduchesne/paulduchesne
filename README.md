Hello, 

![](/paul.jpg)

A few things I like to do in my spare time...

...experiments with Linked Open Data, using [Python](https://www.python.org/), [RDFlib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib), [Wikibase](https://wikiba.se/) and [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/).

...data analysis and visualisation with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter) and [D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3).

...music with [SuperCollider](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider) and [Pure Data](https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data) running on [Raspberry PIs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).
